# Kumonoito
Kumonoito is the silken spidery thread that takes one from *Drake* to *ROS* and back. This thread, cast by the Great Warrior Gesar (**Russ Tedrake**) was woven in the hidden land of **Drake-Shambhala** where Buddhist values and traditions rule and can lead the hordes of the righteous but damned (**Drake Developers**) to climb up towards salvation (**ROS Messages**). 

More practically, this repository exemplifies enables simulations built in Drake to communicate via ROS messages and thus connect with ROS land tools.
