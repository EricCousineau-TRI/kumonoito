Kumonoito : The silken spidery thread that takes one from Drake to ROS and back. This thread, cast by the Great Warrior Gesar (Russ Tedrake) was woven in the hidden land of Drake-Shambhala where Buddhist values and traditions rule and can lead the hordes of the righteous but damned (Drake Developers) into salvation (ROS Messages). 

More practically, this repository exemplifies enables simlations built in Drake to communicate with ROS messages and thus connect with ROS land tools.
